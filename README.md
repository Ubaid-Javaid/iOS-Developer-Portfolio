BOGO Canada was created to offer affordable dining for people who prefer eating out. Traditional delivery apps charge high fees to restaurants, which results in higher prices for customers. To solve this, BOGO Canada partners with restaurants of all sizes to provide Buy One Get One Free deals through app-based redeemable coupons.

Users can subscribe quarterly or yearly to access hundreds of free and discounted meals. They simply visit a restaurant, choose a deal, scan the QR code, and enjoy their savings. BOGO Canada offers a simple, money-saving dining experience and continues to grow beyond Downtown and Mississauga.
